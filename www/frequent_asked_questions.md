### What is a pedigree?

A pedigree or family tree is a graphical representation of the family history of an individual, very useful when studying genetic diseases or conditions. 

</br>


### What is a phenotype?

A phenotype is a characteristic that can be observed in an organism. It results from the combined effect of the genotype (the genetic information) and the environment. 

</br>


### Why do I need to register?

Because PhenTree saves all the pedigrees you create with your user account and allows you to access them in another moment and from another device. Since you have to use a password to access your user account, no one else can see your pedigrees.

However, you do not need to enter any personal information like names or emails. 

</br>


### Can I introduce patients' personal information?

According to the recommendations of the National Society of Genetic Counselors, you should **never** introduce any personal information about the family members that is not relevant for the purpose of the pedigree [14]. This is specially important if the intention is to show the pedigree in a scientific publication to preserve patient confidentiality. 

For example, you should not introduce full names. Instead, you can enter the first name only or the initials. They should be enough to identify the members inside a family. Also, introduce only the year of birth or death instead of the full date.

### How should I represent transgender people?

The National Society of Genetic Counselors recommends to represent transgender people with the symbol that corresponds to their gender, indicating the karyotype formula below the symbol if it is known and if it is clinically relevant (for example, if the phenotype of interest is sex related) [14]. The karyotype formula should also be indicated for non-binary people and people with a disorder of sex development, if known. 

</br>


### How should I order siblings?

Siblings should be ordered from oldest (left) to youngest (right). However, this order is changed sometimes to fit couples and other individuals in the plot. To order them you can use the buttons *Reorder row up* and *Reorder row down* in the summary table. The order in the table will determine the order in the plot. 

</br>


### Can I represent siblings without representing their parents?

No. When the pedigree is generated, individuals are assumed to be siblings when they share the same parents [2]. For this reason, you can not represent the connection line between siblings if you haven't previously defined who their parents are. 

</br>


### Can I represent carriers based on assumptions?

No. You should only indicate that an individual is a carrier of a genetic mutation or alteration if this individual has been genetically tested [14]. You should never assume that an individual is a carrier based only on the mode of inheritance of the phenotypic trait of interest. 

</br>


### Why do some individuals not appear in the plot?

To appear in the plot, individuals must be connected to at least another member of the family. Moreover, the plot can not be generated until at least three individuals are connected. 

</br>


### Can I represent children from a single parent?

No, for now PhenTree does not offer this option. You have to represent two parents for a child. 

</br>


### Can I represent gamete donors?

No, for now PhenTree does not offer this option. 

</br>


### Can I delete my account?

Of course! At the *User account* tab of the superior menu you will see the user account that is currently in use, a button to log out and a button to delete the user account. But remember, you have to delete all your pedigrees before deleting your account.
